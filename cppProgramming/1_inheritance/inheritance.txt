The parent class window will be inherited twice in the class window_with_menu_and_toolbar.
When using features from the window class within a window_with_menu_and_toolbar the programmer will be required to
explicitly indicate which version of the window class to use.

Alternatively virtual inheritance could be used to fix this issue.  The window_with_toolbar and window_with_menu
class would inherit virtually from class window:

class window
{
	...
};

class window_with_toolbar : public virtual window
{
	...
};

class window_with_menu : public virtual window
{
	...
};

class window_with_menu_and_toolbar : public window_with_menu,
									 public window_with_toolbar
{
	...
};
